# Databases Project - NTUA
Part of this course was a team project. The project was about shopping basket analysis and from the assignment [given](https://github.com/BeenCoding/Db-Project-NTUA/blob/master/group%20project%202020.pdf), we had to construct the ER-Diagram. After constructing the ERD we had to build the Relational Diagram and then proceed to the creation of the database using MySQL. When the database was built, we needed to fill in all tables with *valid* data. Next step was building the web app(both backend and frontend) as well as connecting the database with the site.

The report that we handed in for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/BeenCoding/Db-Project-NTUA/blob/master/Databases%20Report%20Team7.pdf).
## _Technologies Used_
  * In order to create the front-end Bootstrap Studio was used.
  * For the back-end Java was used.
  * MySQL Workbench for the database creation.
  * PuTTY and WinSCP were used to manage the server we rented.
  * Navicat was used to manage the database that was hosted in the server.

**Note:** A dedicated server was rent to host the project online. Apache Tomcat 9.0 and MySQL(Version 5.6) were installed to the server and all the files of the project were uploaded.

## _Installation of the project_
* If anyone wants to install this project we created, a host should be rented and MySQL & Apache Tomcat 9.0 should be installed. After the installation, all files that are uploaded to this git should be uploaded to the server (both front-end/back-end and the database file).

**Note:** Team7 Folder contains all the project (backend and frontend). Inside Team7 Folder there are two folders, Project and WEB-INF. Project folder contains all .jsp files (frontend) and assets folder. WEB-INF folder contains all .java and .class files (backend).
